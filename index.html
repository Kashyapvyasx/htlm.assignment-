    <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>
        Hey, Iâ€™m Kashyap but my friends here call me <abbr title="That is the combination First letter of my first and last name "> KV</abbr> . 
        I am from India, so ,English is not my first language, it is actually my 3<sup>rd</sup> language, Hindi and Gujarati are 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> .
        Talking about my hobbies, i love to do canvas painting as well as glass paintings.Apart from
        that i have keen interest in codeing and palying with the codes and all that stuff.
</p>

        <p>
        While i do my codeing stuff , i always keep one quote in my mind which helps me 
        to do my work more accurate, the quote goes like,
         <blockquote><em>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. 
        Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</em> .-<cite>Programing QUOTES</cite>
</blockquote>
